# Mission to Mars

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be visiting different websites to extract data. This method is also known as web scraping. Web scraping automates tasks to pull data instead of manually copying data from multiple websites. We will then be storing this data in MongoDB, a NoSQL database. Then, we will render the data in a web application using Flask. Some additional libraries and tools we will be using are Splinter and Beautiful Soup. Splinter will be used to automate a web browser and Beautiful Soup will be used to parse and extract data.


### Purpose
The purpose of this week's project is to scrape websites that have data pertaining to Mission to Mars. This includes Mars news, Mars images, Mars facts, and images of Mars' hemispheres. We then will use a web application to display the Mars findings.
